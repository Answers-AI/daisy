Prompt: Explain the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application.

File Contents:
```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["dom", "ES2015"],
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "extends": "tsconfig/node.json",
  "include": ["./src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["dist", "build", "node_modules"]
}
```

Summary:
The provided configuration file is used to specify various settings and options for the TypeScript compiler in a larger application. It includes options related to compiler settings, file inclusion and exclusion, and extends another configuration file.

Service:
This configuration file is specific to the TypeScript compiler and is used to define how the TypeScript code in the application should be compiled and processed.

Configuration Summary:
The configuration file overrides the default compiler options and specifies the following settings:
- "lib": Specifies the libraries to be included when compiling the TypeScript code. In this case, it includes the "dom" library for DOM-related features and the "ES2015" library for ECMAScript 2015 features.
- "baseUrl": Specifies the base directory for resolving module names. In this case, it is set to the current directory.
- "outDir": Specifies the output directory for compiled JavaScript files. In this case, it is set to the "dist" directory.

The configuration file also extends another configuration file named "tsconfig/node.json", which likely contains additional compiler options specific to Node.js development.

Configuration Breakdown:
- "compilerOptions": Specifies the compiler options for TypeScript.
  - "lib": An array of library names to include when compiling the code.
  - "baseUrl": The base directory for resolving module names.
  - "outDir": The output directory for compiled JavaScript files.
- "extends": Specifies the path to another configuration file to extend.
- "include": An array of file patterns to include when compiling the code.
- "exclude": An array of file patterns to exclude when compiling the code.

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file interacts with the TypeScript compiler by providing specific options and settings for compiling the TypeScript code in the application. It affects how the code is compiled, which libraries are included, and where the compiled JavaScript files are outputted.

Developer Questions:
Developers working with this code base may have the following questions when debugging or changing this configuration file:
1. What other configuration files can be extended using the "extends" property?
2. How do I add additional compiler options to the "compilerOptions" section?
3. How can I change the output directory for compiled JavaScript files?
4. How do I include or exclude specific files or directories from compilation?
5. What other libraries can be included using the "lib" property?
6. How does changing the "baseUrl" affect module resolution?
7. How can I configure different compiler options for different environments or build configurations?
