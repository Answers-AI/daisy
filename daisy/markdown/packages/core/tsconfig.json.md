Prompt: Explain the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application.

File Contents:
```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["dom", "ES2015"],
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "extends": "tsconfig/node.json",
  "include": ["./src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["dist", "build", "node_modules"]
}
```

Summary:
The provided configuration file is used to specify various settings and options for the TypeScript compiler in a larger application. It includes options related to the compiler, such as the libraries to include, the base URL for module resolution, and the output directory for compiled files. It also extends another configuration file and specifies which files to include and exclude from the compilation process.

Service:
This configuration file is specific to a TypeScript application. TypeScript is a programming language that is a superset of JavaScript and provides static typing and other features to enhance JavaScript development. It compiles TypeScript code into JavaScript code that can be executed by a JavaScript runtime environment.

Configuration Summary:
The configuration file is set up to customize the behavior of the TypeScript compiler. It specifies the libraries to include (dom and ES2015), the base URL for module resolution (current directory), and the output directory for compiled files (dist). It also extends another configuration file (tsconfig/node.json) to inherit additional settings. The include property specifies which files to include in the compilation process, while the exclude property specifies which files to exclude.

Configuration Breakdown:
- compilerOptions: Specifies options for the TypeScript compiler.
  - lib: Specifies the libraries to include during compilation. In this case, it includes the dom library and the ES2015 library.
  - baseUrl: Specifies the base URL for module resolution. It is set to the current directory.
  - outDir: Specifies the output directory for compiled files. It is set to "dist".
- extends: Specifies another configuration file to extend. In this case, it extends "tsconfig/node.json".
- include: Specifies which files to include in the compilation process. It uses a glob pattern to include all files under the "./src" directory and its subdirectories.
- exclude: Specifies which files to exclude from the compilation process. It excludes the "dist", "build", and "node_modules" directories.

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file interacts with the TypeScript compiler to customize its behavior. It specifies the libraries to include, the base URL for module resolution, and the output directory for compiled files. It also extends another configuration file to inherit additional settings. The include and exclude properties determine which files are included or excluded from the compilation process.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I add additional libraries to be included during compilation?
2. How can I change the base URL for module resolution?
3. How can I change the output directory for compiled files?
4. What other configuration files can I extend and what settings do they provide?
5. How can I modify the include and exclude patterns to include or exclude specific files or directories?
