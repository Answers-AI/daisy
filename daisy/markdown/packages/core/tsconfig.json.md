Prompt: Explain the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application.

File Contents:
```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["dom", "ES2015"],
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "extends": "tsconfig/node.json",
  "include": ["./src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["dist", "build", "node_modules"]
}
```

Summary:
The provided configuration file is used to specify various settings and options for the TypeScript compiler in a larger application. It includes options related to compiler settings, file inclusion and exclusion, and extends another configuration file.

Service:
This configuration file is specific to the TypeScript compiler and is used to define how the TypeScript code in the application should be compiled and processed.

Configuration Summary:
The configuration file overrides the default compiler options and specifies the following settings:
- "lib": Specifies the libraries to be included during compilation. In this case, it includes the "dom" library for DOM-related features and the "ES2015" library for ECMAScript 2015 features.
- "baseUrl": Sets the base directory for resolving non-relative module names. In this case, it is set to the current directory.
- "outDir": Specifies the output directory for compiled files. In this case, it is set to the "dist" directory.

The configuration file also extends another configuration file named "tsconfig/node.json", which likely contains additional compiler options specific to Node.js development.

Configuration Breakdown:
- "compilerOptions": Specifies the compiler options for TypeScript.
  - "lib": An array of library names to include during compilation.
  - "baseUrl": The base directory for resolving non-relative module names.
  - "outDir": The output directory for compiled files.
- "extends": Specifies the path to another configuration file to inherit settings from.
- "include": An array of file patterns to include during compilation.
- "exclude": An array of file patterns to exclude from compilation.

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file interacts with the TypeScript compiler to determine how the TypeScript code in the application should be compiled. It affects the libraries included, the base directory for module resolution, the output directory for compiled files, and the files to be included or excluded during compilation.

Developer Questions:
Developers working with this code base may have the following questions when debugging or changing this file:
1. What libraries are included by default and why are "dom" and "ES2015" included in this configuration?
2. How does changing the "baseUrl" affect module resolution in the application?
3. What is the purpose of the "outDir" setting and how does it impact the compiled files?
4. What other configuration options can be specified in the "tsconfig/node.json" file that is being extended?
5. How can I include or exclude specific files or directories from the compilation process?
6. Are there any other configuration files that interact with this one and how do they affect the overall compilation process?
