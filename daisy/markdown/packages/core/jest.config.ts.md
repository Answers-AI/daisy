Script Summary:
The script defines a constant variable named "config" which is an object. This object has two properties: "verbose" and "transform". The "verbose" property is set to true, indicating that the application should output detailed information during its execution. The "transform" property is an object that specifies a transformation to be applied to certain file types. In this case, it uses the "ts-jest" transformation for files with the extension ".ts" or ".tsx".

The script then exports the "config" object as the default export of the module.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I change the verbosity of the application's output?
   - You can modify the value of the "verbose" property in the "config" object. Set it to "true" for detailed output or "false" for minimal output.

2. How can I add or modify file transformations?
   - You can add or modify entries in the "transform" object. Each entry should have a regular expression pattern as the key and the transformation as the value.
