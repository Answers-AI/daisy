Developer Questions:
- How can I disable the verbose output?
To disable the verbose output, simply change the value of the "verbose" property to false in the "config" object.

- How can I add additional transformations for other file types?
To add additional transformations for other file types, you can add new key-value pairs to the "transform" object. The key should be a regular expression that matches the file types you want to transform, and the value should be the transformation you want to apply.

- How can I use a different transformation library?
To use a different transformation library, simply replace the value of the "transform" property with the desired transformation library.
