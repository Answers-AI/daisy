Summary:
This code file contains a collection of functions related to Git operations, specifically for managing and working with commits and files in a Git repository. It provides functions for verifying the validity of a repository, retrieving the current branch, getting a list of changed files, retrieving the diff for a specific file, finding a commit with a specific prefix, getting the latest Daisy commit, adding Markdown files to the repository, and creating a new Daisy commit.

Import statements:
- `DaisyConfig` and `FileGitInfo` are imported from the "./types" module. These are custom types used in the code.
- `exec` is imported from the "child_process" module. It is used to execute shell commands.
- `execAsync` is imported from the "./utils" module. It is a utility function that wraps `exec` in a promise.

Script Summary:
This script provides a set of functions for interacting with a Git repository. It includes functions for verifying the repository, retrieving branch information, getting changed files, retrieving file diffs, finding commits with specific prefixes, adding Markdown files, and creating new commits.

Internal Functions:
- `verifyValidRepo(cwd: string): Promise<string | undefined>`: This function verifies the validity of a Git repository by executing the command "git rev-parse --verify HEAD" in the specified directory. It returns a promise that resolves to a string indicating any errors or undefined if the repository is valid.
- `getCurrentBranch(cwd: string): Promise<string>`: This function retrieves the current branch of a Git repository by executing the command "git branch --show-current" in the specified directory. It returns a promise that resolves to the name of the current branch.
- `getChangedFiles({ cwd, lastCommit, codepath }: { cwd: string; lastCommit: string; codepath: string }): Promise<FileGitInfo[]>`: This function retrieves a list of changed files in a Git repository between the specified last commit and the given code path. It executes the command "git diff --name-status <lastCommit> <codepath>" in the specified directory and parses the output to extract the file status and path. It returns a promise that resolves to an array of FileGitInfo objects representing the changed files.
- `getFileDiff({ file, lastCommit, cwd }: { file: FileGitInfo; lastCommit: string; cwd: string }): Promise<FileGitInfo>`: This function retrieves the diff for a specific file in a Git repository between the specified last commit and the current state. It executes the command "git diff <lastCommit> -- <filePath>" in the specified directory and returns a promise that resolves to a FileGitInfo object representing the file with the diff.
- `findCommitWithPrefix({ cwd, prefix }: { cwd: string; prefix: string })`: This function finds a commit in a Git repository that has a specific prefix in its commit message. It executes the command "git log --grep="<prefix>" -1 --format="%H"" in the specified directory and returns a promise that resolves to the commit hash.
- `getLatestDaisyCommit({ branch, cwd }: { branch: string; cwd: string })`: This function retrieves the latest Daisy commit in a Git repository for the specified branch. It first tries to find a commit with the specific branch prefix using `findCommitWithPrefix`, and if not found, falls back to finding a commit with the general Daisy commit prefix. It returns a promise that resolves to the commit hash.
- `addMarkdownFiles({ config, cwd }: { config: DaisyConfig; cwd: string })`: This function adds Markdown files specified in the DaisyConfig object to the Git repository. It executes the command "git add <markdownDirectory>" in the specified directory and returns a promise.
- `createNewCommit({ cwd, branch }: { cwd: string; branch: string })`: This function creates a new commit in the Git repository with the commit message containing the Daisy commit prefix and the specified branch. It executes the command "git commit --allow-empty -m "<commitMessage>"" in the specified directory and returns a promise.
- `createNewDaisyCommit({ config, branch, cwd }: { config: DaisyConfig; branch: string; cwd: string })`: This function adds the Markdown files specified in the DaisyConfig object to the Git repository and creates a new Daisy commit for the specified branch. It calls `addMarkdownFiles` and `createNewCommit` sequentially.

External Functions:
- `getDaisyCommitPrefixWithBranch(branch: string)`: This function returns the Daisy commit prefix with the specified branch appended to it. It concatenates the `DAISY_COMMIT_PREFIX` constant with the branch name.

Interaction Summary:
This script provides a set of functions that can be used to interact with a Git repository. It can be used to verify the validity of a repository, retrieve branch information, get a list of changed files, retrieve file diffs, find commits with specific prefixes, add Markdown files to the repository, and create new commits. These functions can be used in other parts of the application to perform Git-related operations.
