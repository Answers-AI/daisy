Summary:
This code file contains various functions related to Git operations, specifically for managing commits and files in a Git repository. It provides functions for verifying a valid repository, getting the current branch, retrieving changed files, getting file diffs, finding the latest Daisy commit, adding Markdown files, creating new commits, finding commits with a specific prefix, and creating new Daisy commits.

Import statements:
- `DaisyConfig` and `FileGitInfo` are imported from the "./types" module. These types are likely used for defining the shape of objects used in the functions.
- `exec` is imported from the "child_process" module. It is used for executing shell commands.
- `execAsync` is imported from the "./utils" module. It is a custom utility function for executing shell commands asynchronously.

Script Summary:
This script provides a set of functions for interacting with a Git repository. It includes functions for verifying the repository, retrieving branch information, getting changed files, retrieving file diffs, finding the latest Daisy commit, adding Markdown files, creating new commits, finding commits with a specific prefix, and creating new Daisy commits.

Internal Functions:
- `verifyValidRepo(cwd: string): Promise<string | undefined>`: This function verifies if the given directory is a valid Git repository by executing the "git rev-parse --verify HEAD" command. It returns a promise that resolves to a string indicating any errors or undefined if the repository is valid.
- `getCurrentBranch(cwd: string): Promise<string>`: This function retrieves the current branch of the Git repository by executing the "git branch --show-current" command. It returns a promise that resolves to the name of the current branch.
- `getChangedFiles({ cwd, lastCommit, codepath }: { cwd: string; lastCommit: string; codepath: string }): Promise<FileGitInfo[]>`: This function retrieves the list of changed files between the last commit and a specific code path. It executes the "git diff --name-status" command and parses the output to extract the file paths and their status. It returns a promise that resolves to an array of objects containing the file path and status.
- `getFileDiff({ file, lastCommit, cwd }: { file: FileGitInfo; lastCommit: string; cwd: string }): Promise<FileGitInfo>`: This function retrieves the diff of a specific file between the last commit and the current state. It executes the "git diff" command and returns a promise that resolves to an object containing the file path, status, and the git diff output.
- `getLatestDaisyCommit({ branch, cwd }: { branch: string; cwd: string })`: This function finds the latest Daisy commit for a specific branch or the default Daisy commit. It calls the `findCommitWithPrefix` function with the appropriate prefix and returns the result.
- `addMarkdownFiles({ config, cwd }: { config: DaisyConfig; cwd: string })`: This function adds the Markdown files specified in the Daisy configuration to the Git repository by executing the "git add" command. It returns a promise.
- `createNewCommit({ cwd, branch }: { cwd: string; branch: string })`: This function creates a new commit with a specific branch prefix by executing the "git commit" command. It returns a promise.
- `findCommitWithPrefix({ cwd, prefix }: { cwd: string; prefix: string })`: This function finds a commit with a specific prefix by executing the "git log" command with the appropriate grep pattern. It returns a promise that resolves to the commit hash.
- `createNewDaisyCommit({ config, branch, cwd }: { config: DaisyConfig; branch: string; cwd: string })`: This function adds the Markdown files specified in the Daisy configuration, creates a new commit with the branch prefix, and creates a new Daisy commit. It calls the `addMarkdownFiles` and `createNewCommit` functions.

External Functions:
- `DAISY_COMMIT_PREFIX: string`: A constant variable that represents the prefix for Daisy commits.
- `getDaisyCommitPrefixWithBranch(branch: string): string`: This function returns the Daisy commit prefix with a specific branch name appended to it.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used to interact with a Git repository by providing functions for verifying the repository, retrieving branch information, getting changed files, retrieving file diffs, finding the latest Daisy commit, adding Markdown files, creating new commits, finding commits with a specific prefix, and creating new Daisy commits. It can be integrated into a larger software application that requires Git operations.
