Summary:
This code is a script that is part of a larger software application called Daisy. Its purpose is to process files and generate documentation based on the contents of those files. The script has several functions that handle different aspects of the documentation process, such as retrieving files to process, running completions, and running memorization. The script can be configured with various options, such as skipping completions or updating the documentation based on changes in the codebase.

Import statements:
- `stat` from "fs/promises": This import is used to get information about a file or directory.
- `fileProcessor`, `batchCompletionProcessor`, `batchEmbeddingsProcessor`, `splitFiles`, `writeResponsesToFile`, `getChangedFilesWithStatus` from "./fileProcessor": These imports are functions from the "fileProcessor" module that handle different steps of the documentation process.
- `createNewDaisyCommit`, `getCurrentBranch`, `getLatestDaisyCommit` from "./gitCommands": These imports are functions from the "gitCommands" module that interact with the Git version control system.
- `DaisyConfig`, `FileData` from "./types": These imports are types defined in the "types" module that are used as parameters or return values in the script.
- `dirname` from "path": This import is used to get the directory name of a path.

Script Summary:
The script defines several functions that handle different aspects of the documentation process, such as retrieving files to process, running completions, and running memorization. It also defines a main function that orchestrates the entire process based on the provided configuration.

Internal Functions:
- `getFilesToProcess`: This function retrieves the files to process based on the provided input path, update flag, configuration, current working directory, and branch. It uses the `fileProcessor` function to process all files initially, and if the update flag is set, it uses the `getLatestDaisyCommit` and `getChangedFilesWithStatus` functions to determine the files that have been added or modified since the last commit. It returns an array of `FileData` objects.
- `runCompletions`: This function runs the completions process for the provided files and configuration. It first checks if the completions should be confirmed by calling the `confirmCompletionsFunction`. If confirmed, it splits the files into two arrays: `skipCompletionFiles` and `filesForDocumentation`. It then writes the responses to markdown files using the `writeResponsesToFile` function and runs the batch completion processor using the `batchCompletionProcessor` function. If the skipGit flag is not set, it creates a new Daisy commit using the `createNewDaisyCommit` function. It returns nothing.
- `runMemorization`: This function runs the memorization process for the provided files and configuration. It calls the `batchEmbeddingsProcessor` function to generate embeddings for the files. It returns nothing.
- `main`: This is the main function of the script. It takes several parameters, including skipCompletion, update, inputPath, config, memorize, and confirmCompletionsFunction. It determines the actual input path based on the provided inputPath or the codeBasePath from the configuration. It gets the current working directory and branch using the `stat` and `getCurrentBranch` functions. It then calls the `getFilesToProcess` function to retrieve the files to process. If skipCompletion is false, it calls the `runCompletions` function. If memorize is true, it calls the `runMemorization` function.

External Functions:
- `getFilesToProcess`: This function retrieves the files to process based on the provided input path, update flag, configuration, current working directory, and branch. It returns an array of `FileData` objects.
- `runCompletions`: This function runs the completions process for the provided files and configuration. It returns nothing.
- `runMemorization`: This function runs the memorization process for the provided files and configuration. It returns nothing.
- `main`: This is the main function of the script. It takes several parameters and orchestrates the entire documentation process.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with other modules in the application, such as "fileProcessor" and "gitCommands", to handle different steps of the documentation process. It also uses types defined in the "types" module. The script can be configured with various options, such as skipping completions or updating the documentation based on changes in the codebase.

Developer Questions:
- How can I configure the script to skip completions or update the documentation based on changes in the codebase?
- What are the expected types for the parameters and return values of the functions in this script?
- How does the script determine the files to process and what steps are involved in the completions and memorization processes?
- How does the script interact with the Git version control system and what actions are performed when creating a new Daisy commit?
