Summary:
This code is a script that is part of a larger software application called Daisy. Its purpose is to process files and generate documentation based on certain criteria. The script takes in various parameters and performs a series of operations to process the files, generate documentation, and store the results.

Import statements:
- `fileProcessor`, `batchCompletionProcessor`, `batchEmbeddingsProcessor`, `splitFiles`, `writeResponsesToFile`, and `getChangedFilesWithStatus` are imported from the `fileProcessor` module. These functions are likely responsible for the actual file processing and documentation generation.
- `DaisyConfig` and `FileData` are imported from the `types` module. These types likely define the structure of the configuration and file data used in the script.

Script Summary:
The script defines a function called `main` that takes in a set of properties as its parameters. It performs various operations to process files, generate documentation, and store the results. The script also exports the `main` function as the default export.

Internal Functions:
- `main`: This is the main function of the script. It takes in a set of properties as its parameters and performs the following steps:
  - If an `inputPath` is provided, it is assigned to the `iPath` variable. Otherwise, the `codeBasePath` is assigned to `iPath`.
  - The `fileProcessor` function is called with the `iPath` and `config` parameters to retrieve a list of files to process. The result is assigned to the `allFilesToProcess` variable.
  - If the `update` parameter is `true`, the script retrieves the list of added, modified, and deleted files using the `getChangedFilesWithStatus` function. The `addedFiles` and `modifiedFiles` are combined into a single array called `updatedFiles`.
  - The `allFilesToProcess` array is filtered to only include files whose `filePath` matches the `filePath` of any object in the `updatedFiles` array.
  - If the `skipCompletion` parameter is `true`, the script skips the confirmation step. Otherwise, it calls the `confirmCompletionsFunction` with the `allFilesToProcess` and `config` parameters to confirm if the completions should proceed. The result is assigned to the `shouldContinue` variable.
  - If `shouldContinue` is `true`, the script performs the following steps:
    - The `splitFiles` function is called with the `allFilesToProcess` array to split the files into two arrays: `skipCompletionFiles` and `filesForDocumentation`.
    - The `writeResponsesToFile` function is called with the `skipCompletionFiles` array and an empty array, along with the `config` parameter, to write the responses to markdown files.
    - If `skipCompletion` is `false`, the `batchCompletionProcessor` function is called with the `filesForDocumentation` array and the `config` parameter to process the files for documentation.
    - The script logs the number of new documentation files and calls the `batchEmbeddingsProcessor` function with the `allFilesToProcess` array and the `config` parameter to generate embeddings for the files.
  - If `shouldContinue` is `false`, the script logs that documentation has been canceled.
  - The script waits for the `end` event on the `process.stdin` stream before resolving.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the `fileProcessor` module to perform file processing and documentation generation. It also interacts with the `types` module to use the defined types for configuration and file data.

Developer Questions:
- What does the `fileProcessor` module do and how does it process files?
- What are the properties and structure of the `DaisyConfig` and `FileData` types?
- How does the `batchCompletionProcessor` function process files for documentation?
- What does the `batchEmbeddingsProcessor` function do and how does it generate embeddings?
- How does the `splitFiles` function split the files into two arrays?
- What is the purpose of the `confirmCompletionsFunction` and how is it used?
- How does the `writeResponsesToFile` function write the responses to markdown files?
- What is the purpose of the `getChangedFilesWithStatus` function and how does it retrieve the changed files?
