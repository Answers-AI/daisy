Summary:
This code is a script that is part of a larger software application. Its purpose is to process files and generate documentation based on certain conditions. It includes functions for getting files to process, running completions, and running memorization. The script interacts with other modules for file processing, git commands, and handling configurations.

Import statements:
- `stat` from "fs/promises": This import is used to get information about a file or directory.
- `fileProcessor`, `batchCompletionProcessor`, `batchEmbeddingsProcessor`, `splitFiles`, `writeResponsesToFile`, `getChangedFilesWithStatus` from "./fileProcessor": These imports are functions from the "fileProcessor" module that handle various file processing tasks.
- `createNewDaisyCommit`, `getCurrentBranch`, `getLatestDaisyCommit` from "./gitCommands": These imports are functions from the "gitCommands" module that handle git-related operations.
- `DaisyConfig`, `FileData` from "./types": These imports are types defined in the "types" module.
- `dirname` from "path": This import is used to get the directory name of a path.

Script Summary:
The script defines several functions for processing files and generating documentation. It also includes a main function that orchestrates the execution of these functions based on the provided parameters. The script exports the main function as the default export.

Internal Functions:
- `getFilesToProcess`: This function takes in several parameters related to file processing and returns a promise that resolves to an array of FileData objects. It uses the `fileProcessor` function to process files and filters the result based on certain conditions.
- `runCompletions`: This function takes in several parameters related to running completions and returns a promise that resolves to a boolean value. It calls the `confirmCompletionsFunction` to confirm if completions should be run, and if confirmed, it performs various operations like writing markdown files and calling the `batchCompletionProcessor` function.
- `runMemorization`: This function takes in several parameters related to running memorization and returns a promise. It calls the `batchEmbeddingsProcessor` function to generate embeddings for the provided files.
- `main`: This function is the entry point of the script. It takes in several parameters related to the script's behavior and orchestrates the execution of other functions based on those parameters.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with other modules for file processing, git commands, and handling configurations. It uses functions from the "fileProcessor" module to process files, functions from the "gitCommands" module to perform git operations, and types from the "types" module for type definitions. It also uses the `stat` function from the "fs/promises" module to get information about a file or directory.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the file processing behavior?
- How can I customize the git commands used in the script?
- What are the available configuration options and how can I modify them?
- How can I handle deleted files during the update process?
- How can I extend the script to perform additional operations on the processed files?
