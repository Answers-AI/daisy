Summary:
This code is a script that is part of a larger software application called Daisy. Its purpose is to process files and generate documentation based on the contents of those files. The script has several functions that handle different aspects of the documentation process, such as retrieving files to process, running completions, and running memorization. The script can be configured to update existing documentation or create new documentation from scratch.

Import statements:
- `stat` from "fs/promises": This import is used to get information about a file or directory.
- `fileProcessor`, `batchCompletionProcessor`, `batchEmbeddingsProcessor`, `splitFiles`, `writeResponsesToFile`, `getChangedFilesWithStatus` from "./fileProcessor": These imports are functions from the "fileProcessor" module that handle different steps of the documentation process.
- `createNewDaisyCommit`, `getCurrentBranch`, `getLatestDaisyCommit` from "./gitCommands": These imports are functions from the "gitCommands" module that interact with the Git version control system.
- `DaisyConfig`, `FileData` from "./types": These imports are types used in the script to define the structure of configuration and file data.
- `dirname` from "path": This import is used to get the directory name of a file path.

Script Summary:
The script consists of several functions that handle different aspects of the documentation process. The main function, `main`, orchestrates the entire process by calling other functions based on the provided configuration. The script also exports the `getFilesToProcess` function, which retrieves the files to be processed based on the provided input path and configuration.

Internal Functions:
- `getFilesToProcess`: This function retrieves the files to be processed based on the provided input path, update flag, configuration, current working directory, and branch. It uses the `fileProcessor` function to process all files initially and then filters the files based on the update flag and changed files since the last commit. It returns an array of `FileData` objects.
- `runCompletions`: This function runs the completions process for the provided files and configuration. It splits the files into two categories: files to skip completions and files for documentation. It then writes the skip completion files directly to markdown files and processes the files for documentation using the `batchCompletionProcessor` function. If the skipGit flag is not set, it also creates a new commit and tag using the `createNewDaisyCommit` function. It returns nothing.
- `runMemorization`: This function runs the memorization process for the provided files and configuration. It uses the `batchEmbeddingsProcessor` function to generate embeddings for the files. It returns nothing.

External Functions:
- `main`: This function is the entry point of the script. It takes several parameters, including skipCompletion, update, inputPath, config, memorize, and confirmCompletionsFunction. It determines the input path based on the provided inputPath or the code base path from the configuration. It retrieves the current working directory and branch. It then calls the `getFilesToProcess` function to get the files to process. If skipCompletion is false, it calls the `runCompletions` function. If memorize is true, it calls the `runMemorization` function.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with other modules in the application, such as the "fileProcessor" module for processing files, the "gitCommands" module for interacting with Git, and the "types" module for defining data structures. It also relies on external functions provided through the `confirmCompletionsFunction` parameter.

Developer Questions:
- How can I configure the script to update existing documentation?
- How can I configure the script to create new documentation from scratch?
- How does the script handle deleted files?
- How can I customize the behavior of the `confirmCompletionsFunction` function?
- How can I extend the script to perform additional processing steps on the files?
