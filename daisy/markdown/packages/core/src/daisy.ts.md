Summary:
This code is a script that is part of a larger software application. Its purpose is to process files and generate documentation based on certain conditions. It includes functions for getting files to process, running completions, and running memorization. The script interacts with other modules for file processing, git commands, and handling configurations.

Import statements:
- `stat` from "fs/promises": This import is used to get information about a file or directory.
- `fileProcessor`, `batchCompletionProcessor`, `batchEmbeddingsProcessor`, `splitFiles`, `writeResponsesToFile`, `getChangedFilesWithStatus` from "./fileProcessor": These imports are functions from the "fileProcessor" module that handle file processing tasks.
- `createNewDaisyCommit`, `getCurrentBranch`, `getLatestDaisyCommit` from "./gitCommands": These imports are functions from the "gitCommands" module that handle git-related tasks.
- `DaisyConfig`, `FileData` from "./types": These imports are types used in the script for configuration and file data.
- `dirname` from "path": This import is used to get the directory name of a path.

Script Summary:
The script includes functions for getting files to process, running completions, and running memorization. It also includes a main function that orchestrates the execution of these functions based on input parameters.

Internal Functions:
- `getFilesToProcess`: This function takes input parameters and returns a list of files to process. It uses the `fileProcessor` function to process files and filters them based on certain conditions.
- `runCompletions`: This function takes input parameters and runs completions on the provided files. It writes markdown files and sends files for documentation. It also creates a new commit and tag in the git repository if required.
- `runMemorization`: This function takes input parameters and runs memorization on the provided files. It generates embeddings for the files.
- `main`: This function is the entry point of the script. It takes input parameters and orchestrates the execution of other functions based on the provided parameters.

External Functions:
- `getFilesToProcess`: This function is exported and can be used by other modules to get files to process.
- `runCompletions`: This function is exported and can be used by other modules to run completions on files.
- `runMemorization`: This function is exported and can be used by other modules to run memorization on files.
- `main`: This function is exported and can be used as the main entry point of the script.

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with other modules for file processing, git commands, and handling configurations. It uses the `fileProcessor` module to process files, the `gitCommands` module to perform git-related tasks, and the `types` module for type definitions. It also interacts with the file system and the command line.

Developer Questions:
- How can I modify the conditions for filtering files in the `getFilesToProcess` function?
- Can I customize the behavior of the `runCompletions` function?
- How can I extend the `runMemorization` function to include additional processing steps?
- What are the available options for the `DaisyConfig` type?
