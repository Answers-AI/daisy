Script Purpose and Role:
The purpose of this script is to define and export various types and interfaces used in the broader software application. These types and interfaces are used to define the structure and properties of different objects and data used throughout the application. This script acts as a central location for defining and managing these types, making it easier for developers to understand and work with the application's data structures.

Script Structure:
The script begins with the export statements for different types and interfaces. These exports define the structure and properties of objects used in the application. The types and interfaces are defined using TypeScript syntax.

Import Statements:
There are no import statements in this script.

Types and Interfaces:
1. DaisyConfig: This type defines the configuration options for the Daisy component of the application. It includes properties such as codeBasePath, pineconeIndexName, pineconeNamespace, daisyDirectoryName, markdownDirectory, promptsFilePath, templateFilePath, openAiApiKey, pineconeApiKey, pineconeEnvironment, answerAI, invalidPaths, invalidFileTypes, invalidFileNames, and fileTypes.

2. FileTypeObject: This type defines the structure of a file type object. It includes properties such as type, prompt, template, model, and skipCompletion.

3. FileGitInfo: This type defines the structure of git information for a file. It includes properties such as filePath, status, and gitDiff.

4. ChangedFiles: This type defines the structure of changed files. It includes properties such as addedFiles, modifiedFiles, and deletedFiles, which are arrays of FileGitInfo objects.

5. FileTypeDefinition: This type defines the structure of a file type definition. It includes properties such as fileTypes, pathIncludes, prompt, template, and skipCompletion.

6. PackageJson: This type defines the structure of a package.json file. It includes properties such as name and version.

7. FileContents: This type defines the structure of file contents. It includes properties such as contents and filePath.

8. FileData: This type defines the structure of file data. It includes properties such as filePath, type, prompt, template, skipCompletion, fullPrompt, fileContents, tokens, model, and cost.

Internal Functions:
There are no internal functions in this script.

External Functions:
There are no external functions in this script.

Interaction Summary:
This script does not directly interact with other components or modules in the application. Its purpose is to provide a central location for defining and exporting types and interfaces that can be used by other components or modules.
