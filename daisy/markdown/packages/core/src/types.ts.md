Script Purpose and Role:
The purpose of this script is to define and export various types and interfaces used in the broader software application. These types and interfaces are used to define the structure and properties of different objects and data used throughout the application. This script acts as a central location for defining and managing these types, making it easier for developers to understand and work with the application's data structures.

Script Structure:
The script begins with the export statements for different types and interfaces. These exports define the structure and properties of objects used in the application. The types and interfaces are defined using TypeScript syntax.

Import Statements:
There are no import statements in this script.

Types and Interfaces:
1. DaisyConfig: This type defines the structure of the configuration object used by the application. It includes properties such as codeBasePath, pineconeIndexName, pineconeNamespace, daisyDirectoryName, markdownDirectory, promptsFilePath, templateFilePath, openAiApiKey, pineconeApiKey, pineconeEnvironment, answerAI, invalidPaths, invalidFileTypes, invalidFileNames, and fileTypes.

2. FileTypeObject: This type defines the structure of an object representing a file type. It includes properties such as type, prompt, template, model, and skipCompletion.

3. FileGitInfo: This type defines the structure of an object representing git information for a file. It includes properties such as filePath, status, and gitDiff.

4. ChangedFiles: This type defines the structure of an object representing the changed files in a git repository. It includes properties such as addedFiles, modifiedFiles, and deletedFiles.

5. FileTypeDefinition: This type defines the structure of a file type definition. It includes properties such as fileTypes, pathIncludes, prompt, template, and skipCompletion.

6. PackageJson: This type defines the structure of a package.json file. It includes properties such as name and version.

7. FileContents: This type defines the structure of an object representing the contents of a file. It includes properties such as contents and filePath.

8. FileData: This type defines the structure of an object representing data about a file. It includes properties such as filePath, type, prompt, template, skipCompletion, fullPrompt, fileContents, tokens, model, and cost.

Interaction Summary:
This script does not have any direct interactions with the rest of the application. It is primarily used as a reference for defining and managing types and interfaces used throughout the application.

Developer Questions:
1. How do I define and use different types and interfaces in the application?
2. What are the properties and structure of the DaisyConfig object?
3. How can I define and manage different file types in the application?
4. How can I work with git information for files in the application?
5. What is the structure of the FileData object and how is it used in the application?
6. How can I define and work with package.json files in the application?
7. How can I access and manipulate the contents of files in the application?
