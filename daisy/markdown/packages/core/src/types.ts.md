Script Purpose and Role:
The purpose of this script is to define and export various types and interfaces used within the broader software application. These types and interfaces are used to define the structure and properties of different objects and data used throughout the application. This script acts as a central location for defining and exporting these types, making it easier for other parts of the application to use and understand the data structures.

Script Structure:
The script begins with the export statements for different types and interfaces. These export statements define the structure and properties of different objects used within the application. The types and interfaces are defined using TypeScript syntax.

Import Statements:
There are no import statements in this script.

Types and Interfaces:
1. DaisyConfig: This type defines the structure of the configuration object used by the application. It includes properties such as codeBasePath, pineconeIndexName, pineconeNamespace, daisyDirectoryName, markdownDirectory, promptsFilePath, templateFilePath, openAiApiKey, pineconeApiKey, pineconeEnvironment, answerAI, invalidPaths, invalidFileTypes, invalidFileNames, and fileTypes.

2. FileTypeObject: This type defines the structure of an object representing a file type. It includes properties such as type, prompt, template, model, and skipCompletion.

3. FileInfo: This type defines the structure of an object representing information about a file. It includes properties such as filePath, status, and gitDiff.

4. ChangedFiles: This type defines the structure of an object representing the changes made to files. It includes properties such as addedFiles, modifiedFiles, and deletedFiles.

5. FileTypeDefinition: This type defines the structure of an object representing the definition of a file type. It includes properties such as fileTypes, pathIncludes, prompt, template, and skipCompletion.

6. PackageJson: This type defines the structure of a package.json file. It includes properties such as name and version.

7. FileContents: This type defines the structure of an object representing the contents of a file. It includes properties such as contents and filePath.

8. FileData: This type defines the structure of an object representing data about a file. It includes properties such as filePath, type, prompt, template, skipCompletion, fullPrompt, fileContents, tokens, model, and cost.

Interaction Summary:
This script does not have any direct interactions with other parts of the application. Its purpose is to define and export types and interfaces that can be used by other parts of the application.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I define and use custom file types in the application?
2. What properties are available in the DaisyConfig object and how can I modify them?
3. How can I use the FileData object to store and retrieve information about files?
4. How can I use the ChangedFiles object to track changes made to files?
5. How can I define and use custom file type definitions in the application?
