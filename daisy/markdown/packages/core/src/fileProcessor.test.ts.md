Script Purpose and Role:
The purpose of this script is to process files and directories within a specified code base. It is part of a broader software application that likely involves code analysis or documentation generation. This script is responsible for identifying valid files, determining their file type, and retrieving associated prompts and templates for each file.

Script Structure:
The script begins with import statements for various modules and functions. It then defines a configuration object that contains settings and paths for the script's operation. Next, there are several test blocks that verify the correct behavior of the script's functions. The script is divided into three main sections: the fileProcessor function, the getFileType function, and the isInvalidFile function. Each of these functions is described in detail below.

Import Statements:
- `readdir`, `stat`, and `readFile` are imported from the "fs/promises" module. These functions are used for file system operations such as reading directories, retrieving file information, and reading file contents.
- `resolve` and `join` are imported from the "path" module. These functions are used for resolving and joining file paths.
- `fileProcessor`, `getFileType`, and `isInvalidFile` are imported from local modules. These functions are used for processing files and determining their file type and validity.
- `getTemplateFiles` is imported from a local module. This function is used for retrieving template files.

Classes and Functions:
- `fileProcessor(filePath: string, config: DaisyConfig): Promise<File[]>`: This function processes a single file or a directory. It takes a file path and a configuration object as parameters. It returns a promise that resolves to an array of File objects. The function first checks if the given path is a directory or a file using the `stat` function. If it is a file, it determines the file type using the `getFileType` function and retrieves the associated prompt and template from the configuration object. If it is a directory, it reads the directory using the `readdir` function and processes each file recursively. The function returns an array of File objects, each containing the file path, file type, prompt, template, and skipCompletion flag.
- `getFileType(filePath: string, config: DaisyConfig): FileType`: This function determines the file type of a given file path. It takes a file path and a configuration object as parameters. It returns a FileType object that contains the file type, prompt, template, and skipCompletion flag. The function checks the file extension against the file types defined in the configuration object and returns the corresponding FileType object.
- `isInvalidFile(filePath: string, config: DaisyConfig): boolean`: This function checks if a given file path is invalid based on the configuration object. It takes a file path and a configuration object as parameters. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the file is invalid. The function checks if the file path matches any of the invalid paths, invalid file types, or invalid file names defined in the configuration object.

Loops and Conditional Statements:
- The `fileProcessor` function uses a conditional statement to check if the given path is a directory or a file. If it is a file, it processes the file. If it is a directory, it reads the directory and processes each file recursively.
- The `isInvalidFile` function uses conditional statements to check if the file path matches any of the invalid paths, invalid file types, or invalid file names defined in the configuration object.

Variable Usage:
- The `config` variable is an object that stores various settings and paths for the script's operation. It is used as a parameter in several functions to provide configuration information.
- The `dirPath` variable is used to store the directory path in the test block for processing a directory.
- The `filePath` variable is used to store the file path in the test block for processing a single file.
- The `result` variable is used to store the result of the file processing in the test blocks.

Potential Bugs or Issues:
- The script relies on the configuration object being correctly defined and populated. If any required properties are missing or incorrect, it may cause errors or unexpected behavior. It is important to ensure that the configuration object is properly configured before running the script.
- The script uses mocked functions for file system operations (`readdir`, `stat`, `readFile`) and the `getTemplateFiles` function. While this allows for isolated testing, it may not accurately reflect the behavior of the actual file system or template retrieval. It is important to verify the behavior of these functions in a real environment.

Summary:
This script is responsible for processing files and directories within a code base. It determines the file type of each file, retrieves associated prompts and templates, and identifies invalid files based on a configuration object. The script is structured into three main functions: `fileProcessor`, `getFileType`, and `isInvalidFile`. These functions work together to process files and provide relevant information for further analysis or documentation generation. The script relies on a properly configured configuration object and uses mocked functions for testing purposes.
