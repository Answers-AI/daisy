Script Purpose and Role:
The purpose of this script is to provide various functions and utilities related to reading and manipulating files, compiling prompts, and calculating costs for completion requests using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. It is part of a broader software application that utilizes GPT-3 for generating text based on user input.

Script Structure:
The script starts with import statements for various dependencies and utility functions. It then defines several functions and exports them for use in other parts of the application. Finally, there is a template string and a few utility functions.

Import Statements:
- `readFile` from "fs/promises": This import is used to read the contents of a file asynchronously.
- `{}` from "path": This import is empty, indicating that the script does not use any specific functionality from the "path" module.
- `he` from "he": This import is used for HTML entity decoding.
- `GPT3Tokenizer` from "gpt3-tokenizer": This import is a class that provides tokenization functionality for GPT-3 models.
- `Handlebars` from "handlebars": This import is a templating engine used to compile and render templates.
- `getTemplateFiles` from "./getTemplateFiles": This import is a function defined in a local file that retrieves template files.
- `DaisyConfig`, `FileData`, `FileTypeDefinition`, `FileTypeObject` from "./types": These imports are type definitions used within the script.
- `exec` from "child_process": This import is used to execute shell commands asynchronously.

Classes and Functions:
- `tokenizer`: This is an instance of the `GPT3Tokenizer` class, used for tokenizing text.
- `templateCompiler`: This is a function that takes a string as input and returns a compiled Handlebars template.
- `fileReader`: This is an asynchronous function that takes a file path as input and returns the contents of the file as a string.
- `countTokens`: This function takes a string of text as input, tokenizes it using the `tokenizer`, and returns the number of tokens.
- `CompileCompletionPromptsProps`: This is a type definition for the parameters of the `compileCompletionPrompts` function.
- `compileCompletionPrompts`: This asynchronous function compiles completion prompts based on the provided parameters. It reads template files, compiles the prompt content using Handlebars, and decodes HTML entities.
- `getCompletionModelBasedOnTokenSize`: This function takes the number of tokens as input and returns the appropriate GPT-3 model to use based on the token size.
- `getEstimatedPricing`: This function takes the GPT-3 model and the number of tokens as input and returns the estimated cost of the completion request.
- `generateCostSummary`: This function takes an array of `FileData` objects as input and calculates the cost summary based on the model and tokens of each file.
- `execAsync`: This function executes a shell command asynchronously and returns the output as a promise.

Loops and Conditional Statements:
- The `generateCostSummary` function uses a `forEach` loop to iterate over each `FileData` object in the `files` array. It calculates the cost based on the model and tokens of each file and updates the corresponding variables.
- The `getCompletionModelBasedOnTokenSize` function uses an if-else statement to determine which GPT-3 model to use based on the number of tokens.
- The `getEstimatedPricing` function uses an if-else statement to determine the cost of the completion request based on the model and tokens.

Variable Usage:
- Various variables are used throughout the script to store and manipulate data. Some notable variables include `tokenizer`, `templateCompiler`, `fullPrompt`, `gpt4Files`, `gpt4Cost`, `gpt35Files`, `gpt35Cost`, `skippedTokens`, and `skippedCompletion`.

Potential Bugs or Issues:
- The `compileCompletionPrompts` function catches errors but does not handle them properly. It only logs the error to the console. It would be better to throw an error or return a specific error message to the caller.
- The `getCompletionModelBasedOnTokenSize` function currently only returns a specific model for a specific token range. It would be more flexible to allow for configuration or dynamic determination of the model based on token size.
- The `getEstimatedPricing` function only calculates the cost based on the context tokens and does not consider the response tokens. This may lead to inaccurate cost estimates.

Summary:
This script provides various functions and utilities for working with files, compiling prompts, and calculating costs for completion requests using GPT-3. It imports dependencies for file reading, tokenization, templating, and shell command execution. The script defines functions for reading files, counting tokens, compiling prompts, calculating costs, and generating cost summaries. It also includes utility functions for executing shell commands asynchronously. The script uses loops and conditional statements to iterate over files and make decisions based on token size and model. There are some potential bugs and issues that need to be addressed, such as error handling in the `compileCompletionPrompts` function and more accurate cost estimation in the `getEstimatedPricing` function.
