Summary:
This script is responsible for creating a change log based on the modified files in a git repository. It uses the `getChangedFiles` function from the `fileProcessor` module to retrieve the list of modified files. For each modified file, it generates a summary of the changes using the `createChatCompletion` function from the `openai` module. The generated summaries are stored in an array for further processing.

Import statements:
- `getChangedFiles` from `fileProcessor`: This function is used to retrieve the list of modified files.
- `createChatCompletion` from `openai`: This function is used to generate summaries of the changes in the modified files.
- `countTokens`, `compileCompletionPrompts`, `getCompletionModelBasedOnTokenSize`, `getEstimatedPricing` from `utils`: These functions are used for various utility operations like counting tokens, compiling completion prompts, determining the GPT model based on token size, and estimating pricing.

Script Summary:
The script exports a single function `createChangeLog` that takes an object as a parameter containing the lists of added, modified, and deleted files, as well as a configuration object. It iterates over the modified files and generates a summary of the changes for each file using the `createChatCompletion` function. The generated summaries are stored in an array for further processing.

Internal Functions:
- `createChangeLog`: This is the main function of the script. It takes an object as a parameter containing the lists of added, modified, and deleted files, as well as a configuration object. It iterates over the modified files and generates a summary of the changes for each file using the `createChatCompletion` function. The generated summaries are stored in an array for further processing.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This script interacts with the `fileProcessor` module to retrieve the list of modified files and the `openai` module to generate summaries of the changes. It also uses utility functions from the `utils` module for various operations.

Developer Questions:
- How does the `getChangedFiles` function work and what does it return?
- What parameters does the `createChatCompletion` function accept and what does it return?
- How are the summaries stored and processed in the `summaryArray`?
- How can I adjust the temperature value for the `createChatCompletion` function?
- What further processing needs to be done on the `summaryArray`?
