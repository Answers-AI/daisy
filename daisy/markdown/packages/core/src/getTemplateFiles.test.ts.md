Template:

Summary:
This code is a script that contains two utility functions: `getTemplateFiles` and `readTemplateFile`. These functions are used to retrieve the content of template files. The script is part of a larger software application and is responsible for handling file operations related to templates.

Import statements:
- `getTemplateFiles` and `readTemplateFile` are imported from the `getTemplateFiles` module, which is a local file in the same directory as this script. These functions are used to retrieve the content of template files.
- `readdir` and `readFile` are imported from the built-in `fs/promises` module, which provides asynchronous file system operations. These functions are used to read the contents of directories and files, respectively.
- `parse` and `join` are imported from the built-in `path` module, which provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. These functions are used to parse file paths and join path segments.

Script Summary:
The script contains two utility functions: `getTemplateFiles` and `readTemplateFile`. These functions are used to retrieve the content of template files. The script also includes a test suite using Jest to verify the functionality of these functions.

Internal Functions:
- `getTemplateFiles`: This function takes a `templateFilePath` parameter and returns a promise that resolves to an object containing the content of template files. It uses the `readdir` function to retrieve the list of files in the specified directory, the `join` function to construct file paths, the `parse` function to parse file names, and the `readFile` function to read the contents of each file. The function maps the file names to their content and returns the resulting object.
- `readTemplateFile`: This function takes a `filePath` parameter and returns a promise that resolves to the content of the specified file. It uses the `readFile` function to read the contents of the file.

External Functions:
- None

Interaction Summary:
This script is part of a larger software application and is responsible for handling file operations related to templates. Other components of the application can use the `getTemplateFiles` and `readTemplateFile` functions to retrieve the content of template files.

Developer Questions:
- How do I use the `getTemplateFiles` function to retrieve the content of template files?
- How do I use the `readTemplateFile` function to retrieve the content of a specific template file?
- How do I handle errors when using these functions?
- How do I write tests for these functions using Jest?
- How do I mock the file system operations for testing purposes?

Known Issues or Bugs:
- None

Todo Items:

Summary:
This script provides utility functions for retrieving the content of template files. The `getTemplateFiles` function retrieves the content of all template files in a specified directory, while the `readTemplateFile` function retrieves the content of a specific template file. These functions are used in a larger software application to handle file operations related to templates. The script includes a test suite using Jest to verify the functionality of these functions. No known issues or bugs are present in the script.
