Summary:
This code file contains several functions related to creating chat completions and embeddings using the OpenAI API. It exports functions for creating chat completions with AnswerAI or OpenAI models, as well as creating embeddings with OpenAI models. The code also includes error handling and logging.

Import statements:
- `DaisyConfig` is imported from "./types". It is likely a custom type or interface used for configuration settings.
- `ChatCompletionRequestMessage`, `Configuration`, `CreateChatCompletionResponse`, and `OpenAIApi` are imported from the "openai" package. These are likely types or interfaces provided by the OpenAI API.
- `axios` and `AxiosResponse` are imported from the "axios" package. `axios` is used for making HTTP requests, and `AxiosResponse` is a type representing the response from an Axios request.

Script Summary:
The script exports several functions for creating chat completions and embeddings using the OpenAI API. It also includes error handling and logging.

Internal Functions:
- `createAnswerAiChatCompletion`: This function takes in a model, messages, temperature, and config object. It checks if the config object has an apiKey property. If not, it logs an error and returns. Otherwise, it makes a POST request to the answerAI.chatCompletionUrl endpoint with the provided data and the apiKey in the headers. It returns the completion response.
- `createOpenAiChatCompletion`: This function takes in a model, messages, temperature, and openAi object. It makes a createChatCompletion request to the openAi object with the provided data. It returns the completion response.
- `createChatCompletion`: This function takes in a model, prompt, temperature, config, and openAi object. It first checks if the prompt is empty and returns null if so. It then creates an array of messages with a system message and the user prompt. It checks if the config object has an apiKey property and calls `createAnswerAiChatCompletion` if so, or `createOpenAiChatCompletion` if the openAi object is provided. It returns the completion response.
- `createOpenAiEmbedding`: This function takes in a model, input, and openAi object. It checks if the input is provided and makes a createEmbedding request to the openAi object with the provided data. It returns the embedding response.

External Functions:
- `createAnswerAiChatCompletion`: This function is exported and can be used to create chat completions using the AnswerAI model.
- `createOpenAiChatCompletion`: This function is exported and can be used to create chat completions using the OpenAI model.
- `createChatCompletion`: This function is exported and can be used to create chat completions using either the AnswerAI or OpenAI model, depending on the configuration.
- `createOpenAiEmbedding`: This function is exported and can be used to create embeddings using the OpenAI model.

Interaction Summary:
This code file provides functions for interacting with the OpenAI API to create chat completions and embeddings. It can be used by other parts of the application to generate responses or analyze text data.
