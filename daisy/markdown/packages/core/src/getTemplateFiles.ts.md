Template:
Summary:
This code is a module that provides functions for reading template files and retrieving their contents. It uses the fs/promises module to read files from the file system and the path module to manipulate file paths.

Import statements:
- `readdir` and `readFile` are imported from the `fs/promises` module. These functions are used to read the contents of a directory and a file, respectively.
- `parse` and `join` are imported from the `path` module. `parse` is used to parse a file path and extract its components, while `join` is used to join multiple path segments into a single path.

Script Summary:
This script exports two functions: `readTemplateFile` and `getTemplateFiles`. `readTemplateFile` reads the contents of a template file given its file path, while `getTemplateFiles` reads the contents of all template files in a directory and returns them as an object.

Internal Functions:
- `readTemplateFile(filePath: string)`: This function takes a file path as a parameter and reads the contents of the file using the `readFile` function from the `fs/promises` module. It returns the content as a string.

- `getTemplateFiles(templateFilePath: string)`: This function takes a directory path as a parameter and reads the contents of all files in that directory using the `readdir` function from the `fs/promises` module. It then iterates over the files, reads their contents using `readTemplateFile`, and stores the contents in an object with the file names (without extensions) as keys. Finally, it returns the object containing the template contents.

External Functions:
- `readTemplateFile(filePath: string)`: This function is exported and can be used to read the contents of a template file given its file path. It returns the content as a string.

- `getTemplateFiles(templateFilePath: string)`: This function is exported and can be used to read the contents of all template files in a directory. It returns an object containing the template contents, with the file names (without extensions) as keys.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used by other parts of the application that need to read and retrieve the contents of template files. It provides a convenient way to read individual template files or all template files in a directory.

Developer Questions:
- How do I use the `readTemplateFile` function to read the contents of a template file?
- How do I use the `getTemplateFiles` function to read the contents of all template files in a directory?
- What format are the template contents returned in?
- What happens if the specified file or directory does not exist?
- Are there any performance considerations when using these functions with large template files or directories?
