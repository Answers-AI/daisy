Summary:
This code file is responsible for initializing the configuration file, prompts folder, and templates folder for a software application. It provides functions to copy files and folders, check if a file or folder exists, and create directories if needed. The code is written in TypeScript and uses the fs and path modules from Node.js.

Import statements:
- fs: This module provides functions for interacting with the file system.
- path: This module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.
- DaisyConfig: This is a custom type that represents the configuration for the Daisy application.

Script Summary:
The script consists of several functions that handle the initialization of the configuration file, prompts folder, and templates folder. It also includes a main function called "init" that orchestrates the initialization process.

Internal Functions:
1. initConfigFile: This function copies the default configuration file to the specified code base path if it doesn't already exist. It then loads the configuration from the file and returns it as a DaisyConfig object.

2. copyFolderSync: This function recursively copies a folder from the source path to the destination path. It creates the destination directory if it doesn't exist. It uses the fs module to read the contents of the source directory and copy files or recursively call itself for subdirectories.

3. initPromptsFolder: This function copies the prompts folder from the package resources to the specified folder path if it doesn't already exist. It constructs the local prompts path by joining the folder path, Daisy directory name, and "prompts" subdirectory.

4. initTemplatesFolder: This function copies the templates folder from the package resources to the specified folder path if it doesn't already exist. It constructs the local templates path by joining the folder path, Daisy directory name, and "templates" subdirectory.

5. init: This is the main function that initializes the configuration file, prompts folder, and templates folder. It calls the initConfigFile function to get the configuration, and then calls the initPromptsFolder and initTemplatesFolder functions to copy the necessary folders. Finally, it returns the configuration.

External Functions:
- initConfigFile(codeBasePath: string): Promise<DaisyConfig>: Copies the default config file to the code base path if it doesn't exist, loads the configuration from the file, and returns it as a Promise.

- copyFolderSync(src: string, dest: string): void: Recursively copies a folder from the source path to the destination path synchronously. Creates the destination directory if it doesn't exist.

- initPromptsFolder(config: DaisyConfig, folderPath: string): void: Copies the prompts folder to the specified folder path if it doesn't exist. Uses the configuration to determine the Daisy directory name.

- initTemplatesFolder(config: DaisyConfig, folderPath: string): void: Copies the templates folder to the specified folder path if it doesn't exist. Uses the configuration to determine the Daisy directory name.

- init(codeBasePath: string): Promise<DaisyConfig>: Initializes the configuration file, prompts folder, and templates folder. Returns the configuration as a Promise.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used as part of a larger software application to set up the initial configuration and required folders. It can be called at the start of the application or during an installation process to ensure that the necessary files and folders are present.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I modify the default configuration file?
- You can modify the default configuration file by editing the file located at "../resources/daisyrc". Make sure to follow the structure defined in the DaisyConfig type.

2. How can I add additional prompts or templates?
- To add additional prompts, you can create new files in the "prompts" folder located at "../resources/prompts". The prompts will be copied to the specified code base path during initialization.
- To add additional templates, you can create new files in the "templates" folder located at "../resources/templates". The templates will be copied to the specified code base path during initialization.

3. How can I customize the folder structure or names?
- The folder structure and names are determined by the configuration file. You can modify the configuration file located at ".daisyrc" in the code base path to customize the folder structure and names.
