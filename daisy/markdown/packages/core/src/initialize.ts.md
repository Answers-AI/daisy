Summary:
This code file is responsible for initializing the configuration file and folders for a software application called Daisy. It provides functions to copy files and folders, create necessary folders if they don't exist, and initialize the configuration file. The code interacts with the file system module to perform file operations.

Import statements:
- `fs` is imported from the "fs" module, which provides functions for interacting with the file system.
- `path` is imported from the "path" module, which provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.
- `DaisyConfig` is imported from the "./types" module, which defines the type for the Daisy configuration.

Script Summary:
The script exports several functions that are used to initialize the configuration file and folders for the Daisy application. It also provides helper functions for copying files and folders recursively.

Internal Functions:
1. `copyFolderSync(src: string, dest: string): void`: This function copies a folder recursively from the source path to the destination path. It checks if the destination folder exists and creates it if it doesn't. It uses the `fs` module to perform file operations.

2. `initFolder(targetPath: string, sourcePath: string): void`: This function initializes a folder by copying each file from the source path to the target path if it doesn't already exist. It creates the target folder if it doesn't exist. It uses the `fs` module to perform file operations.

External Functions:
1. `initConfigFile(codeBasePath: string): Promise<DaisyConfig>`: This function initializes the configuration file for the Daisy application. It checks if the local configuration file exists and copies the default configuration file if it doesn't. It then requires the local configuration file and calls the exported function from the file with the `codeBasePath` argument. It returns the configuration object.

2. `initPromptsFolder(config: DaisyConfig): void`: This function initializes the prompts folder by calling the `initFolder` function with the prompts file path from the configuration and the path to the prompts folder in the resources directory.

3. `initTemplatesFolder(config: DaisyConfig): void`: This function initializes the templates folder by calling the `initFolder` function with the templates file path from the configuration and the path to the templates folder in the resources directory.

4. `init(codeBasePath: string): Promise<DaisyConfig>`: This function initializes the configuration file and folders for the Daisy application. It calls the `initConfigFile` function to get the configuration object, then calls the `initPromptsFolder` and `initTemplatesFolder` functions to initialize the prompts and templates folders. It returns the configuration object.

Interaction Summary:
This code file interacts with the file system module to perform file operations such as copying files and creating folders. It also interacts with the configuration file and other resources in the application.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I modify the default configuration file?
   - You can modify the default configuration file by editing the file located at "../resources/daisyrc".

2. How can I add new prompts or templates to the application?
   - You can add new prompts by adding files to the "../resources/prompts" folder.
   - You can add new templates by adding files to the "../resources/templates" folder.

3. How can I change the location of the configuration file or resource folders?
   - You can modify the paths in the `initPromptsFolder` and `initTemplatesFolder` functions to change the location of the prompts and templates folders.
   - You can modify the paths in the `defaultConfigPath` and `localConfigPath` variables in the `initConfigFile` function to change the location of the configuration file.
