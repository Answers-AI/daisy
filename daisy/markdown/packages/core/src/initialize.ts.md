Summary:
This code file is responsible for initializing the configuration file, prompts folder, and templates folder for a software application. It provides functions to copy files and folders, check if a file or folder exists, and create directories if needed. The code is written in TypeScript and uses the fs and path modules from Node.js.

Import statements:
- fs: This module provides functions for interacting with the file system.
- path: This module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.
- DaisyConfig: This is a custom type that represents the configuration for the Daisy application.

Script Summary:
The script consists of several functions that handle the initialization of the configuration file, prompts folder, and templates folder. It also includes a main function called "init" that orchestrates the initialization process.

Internal Functions:
1. initConfigFile: This function copies the default configuration file to the specified code base path if it doesn't already exist. It then loads the configuration from the file and returns it as a DaisyConfig object.

2. copyFolderSync: This function recursively copies a folder from the source path to the destination path. It creates the destination directory if it doesn't exist and copies files using fs.copyFileSync.

3. initPromptsFolder: This function copies the prompts folder from the package resources to the specified folder path if it doesn't already exist. It uses the copyFolderSync function to perform the copying.

4. initTemplatesFolder: This function copies the templates folder from the package resources to the specified folder path if it doesn't already exist. It uses the copyFolderSync function to perform the copying.

5. init: This is the main function that initializes the configuration file, prompts folder, and templates folder. It calls initConfigFile to get the configuration, and then calls initPromptsFolder and initTemplatesFolder to copy the necessary folders. Finally, it returns the configuration.

External Functions:
- initConfigFile(codeBasePath: string): Promise<DaisyConfig>: Copies the default config file to the code base path if it doesn't exist, loads the configuration from the file, and returns it as a Promise.

- copyFolderSync(src: string, dest: string): void: Recursively copies a folder from the source path to the destination path synchronously.

- initPromptsFolder(config: DaisyConfig, folderPath: string): void: Copies the prompts folder to the specified folder path if it doesn't exist, using the configuration object.

- initTemplatesFolder(config: DaisyConfig, folderPath: string): void: Copies the templates folder to the specified folder path if it doesn't exist, using the configuration object.

- init(codeBasePath: string): Promise<DaisyConfig>: Initializes the configuration file, prompts folder, and templates folder. It returns the configuration as a Promise.

Interaction Summary:
This script can be used as part of a larger software application to set up the initial configuration and required folders. It can be called at the start of the application or during an installation process to ensure that the necessary files and folders are present.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I modify the default configuration file?
To modify the default configuration file, you can edit the file located at "../resources/daisyrc". This file contains the default configuration settings for the application.

2. How can I add or modify prompts for the application?
To add or modify prompts for the application, you can add or modify files in the "prompts" folder located in the code base path. These files should follow the required format and structure defined by the application.

3. How can I add or modify templates for the application?
To add or modify templates for the application, you can add or modify files in the "templates" folder located in the code base path. These files should follow the required format and structure defined by the application.
