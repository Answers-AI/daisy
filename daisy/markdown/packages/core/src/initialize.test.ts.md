Summary:
The "test.js" script is a test file that is used to test the initialization functionality of the D.A.I.S.Y. software application. It contains a series of test cases that verify the successful creation of configuration files, prompt folders, and template folders. The script utilizes the "fs" and "path" modules for file system operations and path manipulation. It also imports several functions from the "initialize" module to perform the initialization tasks.

Import statements:
- "fs": This module provides an API for interacting with the file system. It is used to perform file system operations such as creating directories and deleting files.
- "path": This module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. It is used to construct file paths and manipulate path strings.
- "./initialize": This is a local module that contains functions related to the initialization of the D.A.I.S.Y. application. It exports the "init", "initConfigFile", "initPromptsFolder", and "initTemplatesFolder" functions, which are used in the test cases.

Script Summary:
The script defines a helper function called "deleteTestFolder" that is used to delete a test folder if it exists. It then defines a test suite using the "describe" function, which groups related test cases together. Inside the test suite, there are four test cases that verify different aspects of the initialization process. Each test case is defined using the "test" function and contains assertions to verify the expected behavior.

Internal Functions:
- deleteTestFolder(folderPath: string): This function takes a folder path as a parameter and checks if the folder exists. If it does, it recursively deletes the folder using the "fs.rmdirSync" function.

External Functions:
- initConfigFile(testFolder: string): This function takes a test folder path as a parameter and initializes the D.A.I.S.Y. application by creating a ".daisyrc" file with default configurations in the root directory. It returns a Promise that resolves to the configuration object.
- initPromptsFolder(config: object, testFolder: string): This function takes a configuration object and a test folder path as parameters. It creates the prompt folder with default prompts inside the D.A.I.S.Y. application directory.
- initTemplatesFolder(config: object, testFolder: string): This function takes a configuration object and a test folder path as parameters. It creates the templates folder with default templates inside the D.A.I.S.Y. application directory.
- init(testFolder: string): This function takes a test folder path as a parameter and initializes the D.A.I.S.Y. application by calling the "initConfigFile", "initPromptsFolder", and "initTemplatesFolder" functions. It returns a Promise that resolves to the configuration object.

Interaction Summary:
The "test.js" script interacts with the "initialize" module to test the initialization functionality of the D.A.I.S.Y. application. It utilizes the "fs" and "path" modules for file system operations and path manipulation. The test cases verify the successful creation of configuration files, prompt folders, and template folders.

Developer Questions:
- How does the "deleteTestFolder" function handle errors if the folder cannot be deleted?
- What happens if the "testFolder" already exists in the "beforeEach" hook?
- How are the default configurations, prompts, and templates defined in the "initConfigFile", "initPromptsFolder", and "initTemplatesFolder" functions?
- Are there any additional test cases that should be added to cover edge cases?
