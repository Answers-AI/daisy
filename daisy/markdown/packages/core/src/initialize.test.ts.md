Template:

Summary:
The "test.js" script is a test file that is used to test the initialization functionality of the D.A.I.S.Y. software application. It contains a series of test cases that verify the correct creation of configuration files, prompt folders, and template folders. The script utilizes the "fs" and "path" modules for file system operations and path manipulation. It also imports several functions from the "initialize" module to perform the initialization tasks.

Import statements:
- "fs": This module provides an API for interacting with the file system. It is used to perform file system operations such as creating directories and deleting folders.
- "path": This module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. It is used to construct file paths by joining directory names and file names.
- "./initialize": This is a local module that contains functions related to the initialization of the D.A.I.S.Y. application. It exports the following functions: "init", "initConfigFile", "initPromptsFolder", and "initTemplatesFolder". These functions are used in the test cases to perform the initialization tasks.

Script Summary:
The script is a test file that verifies the correct initialization of the D.A.I.S.Y. application. It contains a series of test cases that check the creation of configuration files, prompt folders, and template folders. The test cases are executed using the Jest testing framework.

Internal Functions:
- deleteTestFolder(folderPath: string): This function takes a folder path as a parameter and deletes the folder if it exists. It uses the "fs.existsSync" function to check if the folder exists and the "fs.rmdirSync" function to delete the folder recursively.

External Functions:
- describe("D.A.I.S.Y. initialization", () => {...}): This function is a Jest test suite that groups the test cases related to the initialization of the D.A.I.S.Y. application. It contains the following test cases:
  - test("initConfigFile initializes daisy successfully..."): This test case verifies that the "initConfigFile" function initializes the D.A.I.S.Y. application by creating a ".daisyrc" file with default configurations in the root directory. It calls the "initConfigFile" function with the test folder path and asserts that the ".daisyrc" file exists using the "fs.existsSync" function.
  - test("initPromptsFolder creates the prompt folder..."): This test case verifies that the "initPromptsFolder" function creates the prompt folder with default prompts. It calls the "initConfigFile" function to obtain the configuration object, then calls the "initPromptsFolder" function with the configuration object. It constructs the prompts folder path using the test folder path and the configuration's "daisyDirectoryName" property. Finally, it asserts that the prompts folder exists using the "fs.existsSync" function.
  - test("initTemplatesFolder creates the templates folder..."): This test case verifies that the "initTemplatesFolder" function creates the templates folder with default templates. It follows a similar process as the previous test case, but calls the "initTemplatesFolder" function and checks the existence of the templates folder.
  - test("init initializes daisy with the correct folder structure..."): This test case verifies that the "init" function initializes the D.A.I.S.Y. application with the correct folder structure and user config. It calls the "init" function with the test folder path, obtains the configuration object, constructs the necessary folder paths, and asserts their existence.

Interaction Summary:
The "test.js" script interacts with the "initialize" module to test the initialization functionality of the D.A.I.S.Y. application. It utilizes the "fs" and "path" modules for file system operations and path manipulation. The script does not have direct interactions with other components of the application.

Developer Questions:
- How can I add additional test cases to cover more scenarios during the initialization process?
- What are the default configurations used in the ".daisyrc" file and how can I modify them?
- Can I use different folder names for prompts and templates instead of the default ones?
