The purpose of this code is to provide a breakdown and analysis of a configuration file within a software application. The script takes in a prompt and the contents of the file as input and generates a summary, configuration breakdown, interaction summary, and developer questions.

The structure of the script is a multi-line string enclosed in triple quotes. It contains placeholders for the prompt and file contents, which will be replaced with actual values when the script is executed.

There are no import statements in this script.

The script does not define any classes or functions. It is a simple text template that generates a formatted output based on the input provided.

There are no loops or conditional statements in this script.

The script uses variables to store the prompt and file contents. These variables are then used to generate the output.

There are no known issues or bugs with this script. However, it is important to note that this script is a template and does not perform any actual analysis or breakdown of the configuration file. It is meant to be modified and extended by adding the necessary logic to analyze the configuration file.

To use this script, you would need to replace the placeholders "{{prompt}}" and "{{fileContents}}" with the actual prompt and file contents. You can then execute the script to generate the desired output.

In summary, this script provides a template for generating a breakdown and analysis of a configuration file within a software application. It can be modified and extended to add the necessary logic for analyzing the configuration file.
