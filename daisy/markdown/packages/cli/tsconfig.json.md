Prompt: Explain the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application.

File Contents:
```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["dom", "ES2015"],
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "extends": "tsconfig/node.json",
  "include": ["./src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["dist", "build", "node_modules"]
}
```

Summary:
The provided configuration file is used to specify various settings and options for the TypeScript compiler in a larger application. It includes options related to the compiler, such as the libraries to include, the base URL for module resolution, and the output directory for compiled files. It also extends another configuration file and specifies which files to include and exclude from the compilation process.

Service:
This configuration file is specific to a TypeScript application. TypeScript is a programming language that is a superset of JavaScript and provides static typing and other features to enhance JavaScript development.

Configuration Summary:
The configuration file is set up to customize the behavior of the TypeScript compiler. It specifies the libraries to include (dom and ES2015), sets the base URL for module resolution to the current directory, and sets the output directory for compiled files to "dist". It also extends another configuration file named "tsconfig/node.json" and includes all files under the "./src" directory while excluding the "dist", "build", and "node_modules" directories.

Configuration Breakdown:
- `compilerOptions`: Specifies options for the TypeScript compiler.
  - `lib`: An array of libraries to include. In this case, it includes the "dom" library for DOM-related features and the "ES2015" library for ES2015 language features.
  - `baseUrl`: Specifies the base URL for module resolution. In this case, it is set to the current directory.
  - `outDir`: Specifies the output directory for compiled files. In this case, it is set to "dist".
- `extends`: Specifies another configuration file to extend. In this case, it extends the "tsconfig/node.json" file.
- `include`: Specifies which files to include in the compilation process. It uses a glob pattern to include all files under the "./src" directory.
- `exclude`: Specifies which files to exclude from the compilation process. It excludes the "dist", "build", and "node_modules" directories.

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file interacts with the TypeScript compiler to customize its behavior. It sets options related to the compiler, includes and excludes specific files from the compilation process, and extends another configuration file for additional settings. The configuration file helps ensure that the TypeScript code is compiled correctly and that the output is placed in the specified directory.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I add additional libraries to the compilation process?
2. Can I change the base URL for module resolution to a different directory?
3. What happens if I remove the "extends" property or change the extended configuration file?
4. How can I include or exclude specific files or directories from the compilation process?
5. Can I change the output directory for compiled files to a different location?
6. Are there any other compiler options that can be customized in this configuration file?
7. How does the "include" property handle nested directories and subdirectories?
8. What is the purpose of excluding the "dist", "build", and "node_modules" directories?
9. Can I use a different configuration file for different environments or build processes?
10. How does this configuration file affect the overall build process and output of the application?
