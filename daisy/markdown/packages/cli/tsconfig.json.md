Prompt: Explain the purpose and functionality of a configuration file in a larger application.

File Contents:
```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["dom", "ES2015"],
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "extends": "tsconfig/node.json",
  "include": ["./src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["dist", "build", "node_modules"]
}
```

Summary:
The provided configuration file is used to specify various settings and options for the TypeScript compiler in a larger application. It includes options related to the compiler, such as the libraries to include, the base URL for module resolution, and the output directory for compiled files. It also extends another configuration file and specifies which files to include and exclude from the compilation process.

Service:
This configuration file is specific to a TypeScript application. TypeScript is a programming language that is a superset of JavaScript and provides static typing and other features to enhance JavaScript development.

Configuration Summary:
The configuration file is set up to customize the behavior of the TypeScript compiler. It specifies the libraries to include (dom and ES2015), sets the base URL for module resolution to the current directory, and sets the output directory for compiled files to "dist". It also extends another configuration file named "tsconfig/node.json" and includes all files under the "./src" directory while excluding the "dist", "build", and "node_modules" directories.

Configuration Breakdown:
- `compilerOptions`: Specifies options for the TypeScript compiler.
  - `lib`: An array of libraries to include. In this case, it includes the "dom" library for DOM-related features and the "ES2015" library for ES2015 features.
  - `baseUrl`: Specifies the base URL for module resolution. In this case, it is set to the current directory.
  - `outDir`: Specifies the output directory for compiled files. In this case, it is set to "dist".
- `extends`: Specifies another configuration file to extend. In this case, it extends the "tsconfig/node.json" file.
- `include`: Specifies which files to include in the compilation process. It uses a glob pattern to include all files under the "./src" directory.
- `exclude`: Specifies which files to exclude from the compilation process. It excludes the "dist", "build", and "node_modules" directories.

Interaction Summary:
The configuration file interacts with the TypeScript compiler to customize its behavior. It sets options related to libraries, module resolution, output directory, and file inclusion/exclusion. These settings affect how the TypeScript compiler compiles the source code of the application.

Developer Questions:
1. What libraries are included in the compilation process and why?
2. How does the base URL for module resolution affect the application's module loading behavior?
3. Where are the compiled files outputted and why was the "dist" directory chosen?
4. What is the purpose of extending another configuration file and what settings does it provide?
5. How are the files included and excluded from the compilation process determined?
6. Are there any other configuration options that can be added or modified to further customize the compiler's behavior?
