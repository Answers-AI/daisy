The purpose of this code is to provide a breakdown and analysis of a configuration file within a software application. The script takes in a prompt and the contents of the file as input and generates a summary, configuration breakdown, interaction summary, and developer questions.

The structure of the script is a multi-line string enclosed in triple quotes. It contains placeholders for the prompt and file contents, which will be replaced with actual values when the script is executed.

There are no import statements in this script.

The script does not define any classes or functions. It primarily focuses on generating a breakdown and analysis of the configuration file.

The script does not contain any loops or conditional statements. It is a simple string template that generates a report based on the provided input.

Variable usage in this script is minimal. The script uses the variables `prompt` and `fileContents` to store the input values provided by the user.

There are no known issues or bugs with this script. However, it is important to note that the script assumes the input values are correctly formatted and do not contain any syntax errors.

To use this script, you would need to replace the `{{prompt}}` and `{{fileContents}}` placeholders with actual values. Once the placeholders are replaced, you can execute the script to generate a breakdown and analysis of the configuration file.

In summary, this script serves as a template for generating a breakdown and analysis of a configuration file within a software application. It provides a summary, configuration breakdown, interaction summary, and developer questions based on the provided input. The script does not contain any complex logic or functionality and can be easily modified or extended to suit specific needs.
