Summary:
The "gitUtils" script provides a set of utility functions for interacting with Git repositories. These functions include setting up a user, pulling a branch, pushing changes, switching branches, resetting changes, committing changes, checking if the repository is clean, checking if a file is ignored, checking if there are changes in Markdown files, checking if the current head is a merge commit, finding a commit with a specific prefix, and getting the latest commit on a branch.

Import statements:
- No import statements are present in the code.

Script Summary:
The script exports several utility functions for interacting with Git repositories. These functions can be used to perform common Git operations such as pulling, pushing, committing, and checking the status of a repository.

Internal Functions:
- No internal functions are defined in the code.

External Functions:
1. setupUser: This function sets up the user for the Git repository. It does not take any parameters and does not return anything.

2. pullBranch: This function pulls the specified branch from the remote repository. It takes a branch name as a parameter and does not return anything.

3. push: This function pushes the specified branch to the remote repository. It takes a branch name as a parameter and an optional "force" parameter to force the push. It does not return anything.

4. pushTags: This function pushes all tags to the remote repository. It does not take any parameters and does not return anything.

5. switchToMaybeExistingBranch: This function switches to the specified branch if it exists in the local repository. It takes a branch name as a parameter and does not return anything.

6. reset: This function resets the repository to the specified state. It takes a path specification and an optional "mode" parameter to specify the reset mode. It does not return anything.

7. commitAll: This function commits all changes in the repository with the specified message. It takes a commit message as a parameter and does not return anything.

8. checkIfClean: This function checks if the repository is clean, i.e., if there are no uncommitted changes. It does not take any parameters and returns a boolean indicating the cleanliness status.

9. isIgnored: This function checks if the specified file is ignored in the repository. It takes a file path as a parameter and returns a boolean indicating if the file is ignored.

10. hasChangedMarkdownFiles: This function checks if there are any changes in the Markdown files in the specified directory. It takes a directory path as a parameter and returns a boolean indicating if there are changes.

11. isCurrentHeadAMergeCommit: This function checks if the current head of the repository is a merge commit. It does not take any parameters and returns a boolean indicating if it is a merge commit.

12. findCommitWithPrefix: This function finds a commit with the specified prefix in the repository. It takes a prefix string as a parameter and returns the commit hash if found, or undefined otherwise.

13. getLatestDaisyCommit: This function gets the latest commit on the specified branch in the repository. It takes a branch name as a parameter and returns the commit hash if found, or undefined otherwise.

Interaction Summary:
The "gitUtils" script can be used by other parts of the software application to perform various Git operations. For example, it can be used to set up the user, pull and push branches, reset changes, commit changes, check the repository status, and perform other Git-related tasks.

Developer Questions:
1. How do I set up the user for the Git repository?
- You can use the "setupUser" function to set up the user for the Git repository. Simply call the function without any parameters.

2. How do I pull a specific branch from the remote repository?
- You can use the "pullBranch" function and provide the branch name as a parameter.

3. How do I push changes to a specific branch in the remote repository?
- You can use the "push" function and provide the branch name as a parameter. You can also specify the "force" parameter to force the push if needed.

4. How do I push all tags to the remote repository?
- You can use the "pushTags" function without any parameters.

5. How do I switch to a specific branch if it exists in the local repository?
- You can use the "switchToMaybeExistingBranch" function and provide the branch name as a parameter.

6. How do I reset the repository to a specific state?
- You can use the "reset" function and provide the path specification and an optional "mode" parameter to specify the reset mode.

7. How do I commit all changes in the repository with a specific message?
- You can use the "commitAll" function and provide the commit message as a parameter.

8. How do I check if the repository is clean?
- You can use the "checkIfClean" function without any parameters. It will return a boolean indicating if the repository is clean or not.

9. How do I check if a specific file is ignored in the repository?
- You can use the "isIgnored" function and provide the file path as a parameter. It will return a boolean indicating if the file is ignored or not.

10. How do I check if there are changes in Markdown files in a specific directory?
- You can use the "hasChangedMarkdownFiles" function and provide the directory path as a parameter. It will return a boolean indicating if there are changes or not.

- You can use the "isCurrentHeadAMergeCommit" function without any parameters. It will return a boolean indicating if the current head is a merge commit or not.

12. How do I find a commit with a specific prefix in the repository?
- You can use the "findCommitWithPrefix" function and provide the prefix string as a parameter. It will return the commit hash if found, or undefined otherwise.

13. How do I get the latest commit on a specific branch in the repository?
- You can use the "getLatestDaisyCommit" function and provide the branch name as a parameter. It will return the commit hash if found, or undefined otherwise.
