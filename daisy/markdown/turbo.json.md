Summary:
This configuration file is used in a larger application to define various settings and dependencies. It follows a specific schema defined by Turbo Build. The file includes global dependencies, global environment variables, and a pipeline with different stages such as build, lint, and dev.

Service:
The service that this configuration file is for is not explicitly mentioned in the file itself. However, based on the schema URL, it can be inferred that this configuration file is used in conjunction with Turbo Build, which is a build automation service.

Configuration Summary:
The configuration file sets up global dependencies, global environment variables, and a pipeline with different stages. It specifies that the build stage should only output new files, depend on the "build" stage, and include specific output directories. The lint stage has no outputs, and the dev stage depends on the "build" stage and disables caching.

Configuration Breakdown:
- "$schema": Specifies the schema URL for validating the configuration file.
- "globalDependencies": Defines global dependencies using glob patterns.
- "globalEnv": Specifies global environment variables.
- "pipeline": Defines the pipeline with different stages.
  - "build": Specifies the build stage with settings such as output mode, dependencies, and outputs.
  - "lint": Specifies the lint stage with no outputs.
  - "dev": Specifies the dev stage with dependencies and caching settings.

Interaction Summary:
This configuration file interacts with the Turbo Build service by defining the pipeline stages and their respective settings. It allows developers to customize the build process, specify dependencies, and control caching behavior.

Developer Questions:
1. How can I add additional global dependencies to the application?
2. What are the available options for the "outputMode" in the build stage?
3. How can I modify the outputs for the build stage?
4. What is the purpose of the lint stage and how can I configure it?
5. How does the caching setting in the dev stage affect the application's development process?
6. Can I add more stages to the pipeline and how do I configure them?
